grml-x(1)
=========

Name
----
grml-x - create xorg.conf file and start X window system on grml-system

Synopsis
--------
grml-x [ options ] $windowmanager_you_want_to_use

Description
-----------

grml-x creates the configuration file for the X server (X.org) letting you
override some options and then starts up X server with the specified window
manager.

Implementation
--------------

grml-x depends on the X server to configure itself. It will generate a very
minimal xorg.conf, or, at your option, write some common options to it.
If an xorg.conf file already exists, grml-x won't touch the file unless the
'--force' option is specified.

If you specify a window manager, the x-window-manager alias will be updated.

*******************************************************************************
Important! Please do **not** run X or grml-x with root permissions!  When used in grml
live-cd mode running grml-x works as normal user as well (thanks to sudo). Just
switch to an appropriate console where user grml is logged in (for example on
tty5 via pressing Alt-F5).
If you use grml-x on systems other than grml in live mode you can invoke
it as user root but please use the '--nostart' option to avoid startup
X server. This allows you to generate a xorg.conf file on harddisk systems
as well as on distributions other than grml/Debian.
*******************************************************************************

[NOTE]
Notice that you do not have to use grml-x to start X server if you already have
a working X config file (usually the case on harddisk installations).  Just
adjust $HOME/.xinitrc to your needs (most common is adjusting the exec line for
choosing the according windowmanager) and then run startx to start X server.

Options
-------

XOPTS='...'::
        Provide options for startx, see 'man 1 startx'.

--display <number>::
        Specify display for use with Xserver.

--force::
        Force creation of xorg.conf file. This option is also assumed when another
        option which needs to be write values to the X config file is provided. The old
        X config file (/etc/X11/xorg.conf or /etx/X11/XFree86Config-4) is renamed
        via adding the extension .old.

--help::
        Display help.

--hsync <number>::
        Specify horizontal sync frequencies. Use a number like "30-65".

--mode <width>x<height>::
        Set resolution for X server.

--module <name>::
        Use <name> as module for X server.

--nostart::
        Do not start X server (useful when you want to generate new xorg.conf
        only. Do not forget to use -force option as well if xorg.conf exists
        already.)
--vsync <number>::
        Specify vertical sync frequencies. Use a number like "50-60".

Usage examples
--------------

grml-x --mode '1280x1024 1024x768' wm-ng::
        Use resolutions 1280x1024 and 1024x768 and start windowmanager wm-ng.

grml-x -module vesa openbox::
        Use vesa-module and start windowmanager openbox.

grml-x --hsync "30-65" fluxbox::
        Use 30-65kHz for horizontal sync frequency and start windowmanager fluxbox.

grml-x --display 8 ratpoison::
        Use display 8 for Xserver and start windowmanager ratpoison.

grml-x --nostart -f fluxbox::
        Force writing of config file but do not start X server. Please do not forget to
        add a window manager as last option because grml-x changes the according
        exec-statement in $HOME/.xinitrc.

Known problems and limitations
------------------------------

Sometimes the X server does not find the correct resolution and/or frequency
settings for the monitor. Please adjust configuration manually using the --hsync
and the --vsync options then. Also check out the <<X7,usage examples section>> 
in this manpage and the help output of grml-x running 'grml-x --help'.
